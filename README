				gds2000tools
_______________________________________________________________________________

gds2000tools is a set of free software tools for usage with the GW Instek
GDS-2000 series oscilloscopes (GDS-2062, GDS-2064, GDS-2102, GDS-2104,
GDS-2202, GDS-2204).

The tools should also work (not tested) with the Voltcraft-plus DSO-8000
series oscilloscopes (DSO-8062, DSO-8064, DSO-8104, DSO-8204), GW
Instek GDS-1000 series oscilloscopes (GDS-1022, GDS-1042, GDS-1062,
GDS-1102), Voltcraft-plus DSO-4000 series oscilloscopes (DSO-4022,
DSO-4042, DSO-4062, DSO-4102), and GW Instek GDS-800 series oscilloscopes
(GDS-806, GDS-810, GDS-820, GDS-840).

The tools are:

	gdsh	A set of bash shell functions to create a shell
		for sending and receiving data to/from the oscilloscope.

		Some features are:

		* Most GDS-8x0, all GDS-1000, and all GDS-2000
		  request and query commands as defined in the
		  programming manuals supported.

		* Several undocumented commands supported.

		* Obtaining screen snapshots (gds-snapshot function)

		* Plotting waveform data (gds-plot function)

		* Syncing the oscilloscope's date and time from the
		  comuter's system time (gds-sync* functions).

		* Obtaining measures. Either as single measures or
		  at fixed intervals. 25+ measurement types are
		  supported (gds-measure fucntion).

	gds-read-bin
		A filter for reading binary waveform data and
		binary screen snapshot data from the oscilloscope and
		convert the data to ASCII. gdsh uses this filter.

	gds-bandwidth	gds-channels	gds-csv		gds-firmware
	gds-flush	gds-measure	gds-plot	gds-query
	gds-read-bin	gds-send	gds-serialnum	gds-snapshot
	gds-sync	gds-sync-date	gds-sync-time	gds-type
	gds-vendor	gds-version
		Shortcuts to gdsh functions of the same name.

You will not be able to use most of the software without being familiar
with the commands described in the above manuals.

______________
Hardware Setup

The tools should support the RS232 and the USB interface. The USB
interface in the GDS-2000 series oscilloscopes implements a serial
interface (CDC-ACM USB profile). Current Linux and BSD distributions
already come with the necessary driver to handle the profile and
provide the mapping to a "terminal" device. It is highly recommended
to use the USB connection for performance reasons.

_____________
Prerequisites

At least the following items are needed to build and make use of the
software:

* A supported oscilloscope

* GNU make

* GNU C compiler

* bash 3.0 or later

* gnuplot http://www.gnuplot.info/

* eog or another image viewer capable of displaying BMP images

* GNU versions of misc. Unix text processing tools

____________
Installation

* Edit the installation section in the file config.mk in this
  directory

* Run
	make clean
	makes

  from this directory.

* If configured to be installed in a public directory (default in config.mk)
  become superuser

* Run
	make install

  to install.

* For each user create a $HOME/.gdshrc file with the following contents

  GDSH_CONNECT_AT_START=1
  GDSH_DEV=<device to which oscilloscope is connected, e.g /dev/ttyACM0>

  Note: Only one user can use the oscilloscope at the same time.
